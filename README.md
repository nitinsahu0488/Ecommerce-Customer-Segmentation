# Ecommerce-Customer-Segmentation
### A key challenge for e-commerce businesses is to analyze the trend in the
market to increase their sales. The trend can be easily observed if the
companies can group the customers; based on their activity on the ecommerce site. This grouping can be done by applying different criteria like
previous orders, mostly searched brands and so on. 
#### In this project we try to segment or cluuster the customers who have a similar interest. So, that companies can directly target their particular 
customers and increase thier profitability without wasting their efforts to the uninterested customers.
